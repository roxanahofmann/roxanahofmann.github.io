# Hi!

My name is Roxana Hofmann. I am a first year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh with a fondness for research methodology and computational modelling such as that of intraindividual variability and nuancedness in personality. Under supervision of Dr. René Mõttus (University of Edinburgh) and Prof. Sandra Matz (Columbia University, New York), I study the predictability of gender from personality, physical mobility and social media behaviour using machine learning models. My primary aim is to understand gender inequalities and moderators of such. I also hope to challenge the common, binary (classification-like) concept of gender.

I am also interested in rather sociologically tinted questions around personal taste in arts and music and use of technology in digital societies. In collaboration with Etienne Ollion and Felix Lennert (Ecolė Polytechnique, Paris), I am currently investigation mysogyny in popular music.

I am familiar and comfortable with various methods of research and statistical data analysis using R and aim to use this knowledge to investigate complex psychological and societal phenomena. I am also a dancer, artist, and barista and love indulging in a variety of things as much as I love doing research.
