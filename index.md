# Hi!
<br>
My name is Roxana Hofmann. I am a first year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh with a fondness for research methodology and computational modelling such as that of intraindividual variability and nuancedness in personality. Under supervision of [Dr. René Mõttus](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/rene-mottus) (University of Edinburgh) and [Prof. Sandra Matz](https://sandramatz.com) (Columbia University, New York), I study the predictability of gender from personality, physical mobility and social media behaviour using machine learning models. My primary aim is to understand gender inequalities and moderators of such. With my research, I also hope to challenge the common, binary (classification-like) concept of gender.

I am interested in a variety of research questions from methodological (e.g., testing ergodicity in longitudinal covariance structures) and psychological (e.g., within-person and within-trait personality) to rather sociologically tinted questions (e.g., personal taste in the arts and use of technology in digital societies). In my research I like to facilitate collaborations from all around the world. For example, currently I collaborate on diverse research topics in computational social and behavioural science with Universities of Columbia, Stanford, Yale, Cambridge, Oxford, Tartu, Linköping, Ulm and Ecole Polytechnique. 

<!-- I also am interested in applying computational social science methods to investigate questions around personal taste in arts and music and use of technology in digital societies. For example, in collaboration with [Prof. Etienne Ollion](https://ollion.cnrs.fr/english/) (Ecolė Polytechnique, Paris), I am currently investigating mysogyny in popular music using text mining methods and natural language processing. -->

I am familiar and comfortable with various methods of research and statistical data analysis using R and aim to use this knowledge to investigate complex psychological and societal phenomena. I am also a dancer, artist, and barista and love indulging in a variety of things as much as I love doing research.
